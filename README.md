# Dotfiles with `stow`

Layout of this `~/dotfiles/` directory mimics the layout of the home directory.

Meaning, `~/.bashrc` needs to be `~/dotfiles/.bashrc`

# Info
- `stow` will ignore `.git` and this README by default, meaning, they will not be linked to any entries in the parent (in this case home) directories
